Algorithm to Count Words and Vowels in a Sentence:

1. Create three counters wordCount , vowelCount , and charCount and set the values to 0.
2. Create another variable `sentence` to store the input sentence.
3. Read the input sentence terminated by a period ('.') and store it in the `sentence` variable.
4. Iterate through each character in the `sentence`:
   a. If the character is an alphabet letter:
      i. Increase the `charCount` by 1.
      ii. If the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u,), increase the `vowelCount` by 1.
   b. If the character is a space:
      i. Increase the `wordCount` by 1 to count a word.
5. Display the following information:
   - The number of words in the sentence (wordCount).
   - The number of vowels in the sentence (vowelCount).
   - The total number of characters in the sentence, including spaces (charCount).
